+ Basic usage test (going to configure the server port)
+ Uniform configuration-supporting command registration for modules: I'm
  going to add a "commands" object to modules that will include all the
  information about the commands along with the callbacks for them. Then
  I'll link command registration to configuration loading.
- UI for changing the configuration during runtime.
- Support for user data files for modules (for large data that shouldn't
  be in the configurations themselves).
- User data editor: raw (use shell to open Notepad for data files).
- User data editor: built-in, data-specific interface that allows visual
  editing of the data (each module will need to define these editors for
  itself).
