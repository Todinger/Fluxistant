Loyality:
Me as an orange Mortal Kombat ninja (like Sub-Zero and Scorpion, but in orange) with my hands pressed together in thanks like in this drawing: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ayj4jaby9iqlnwh/Thank%20You%20Pose.png?dl=0

Bitality:
Me as that MK ninja again, with Twitch bits (the bit icon) falling down from above while I'm trying to catch them in something. Similar idea to this drawing:

Loyality:
Me as an orange Mortal Kombat ninja (like Sub-Zero and Scorpion, but in orange) with a "YAY!" pose and a hole in my abdomen with my guts spilling out (a "happy death from people subbing" kind of scene).

Bitality:
Me as that MK ninja again, this time killed by Twitch bits (that purple bit icon). So I'm pinned to the wall by sharp bits, kind of like dagger-throwing in the circus.
